# 🕵️‍♀️ COVID-19 Global Vaccine Tracker ☎️

👋 Greetings!

I'm Qaisara Mardhiah 👩🏻‍💻, and I'm excited to present my first capstone project for Data Analysis:

💸 Tracking COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution. 📱

In this data analysis project 📊, we leveraged the power of Tableau 🖥️ to construct an inclusive and interactive platform for tracking global data 🌍 related to the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines 💉. Users can delve into the details of vaccination progress, whether by country, region, or specific vaccine types, enabling them to uncover valuable insights 🧐, including critical metrics such as administered doses 💉 and population coverage 🌐. This resource serves as a valuable tool for data-driven decision-makers 👩‍💼👨‍💼, healthcare analysts 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️, and the wider public 🌏, granting them access to real-time updates on worldwide vaccination initiatives 🌎.

This project serves as a testament to the potential of data analysis and the application of statistical techniques in addressing real-world challenges. It lays the foundation for future data-centric initiatives, highlighting the capacity of these technologies to bring about substantial positive changes. 🎉💪🏻
